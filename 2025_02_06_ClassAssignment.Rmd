```{r} 
#Create a vector named 'z' with the values 1 to 200
z <- 1:200

#Print the mean and standard deviation of z on the console
mean(z)
sd(z)

#Create a logical vector named zlog that is 'TRUE' for z values greater than 30 and 'FALSE' otherwise.
zlog <- z > 30 

#Make a dataframe with z and zlog as columns. Name the dataframe zdf
zdf <- data.frame(z, zlog)

#Change the column names in your new dataframe to equal “zvec” and “zlogic”
colnames(zdf) <- c("zvec", "zlogic")

#Make a new column in your dataframe equal to zvec squared (i.e., z2). Call the new column zsquared. 
zdf$zsquared <- (zdf$zvec^2)

#Subset the dataframe with and without the subset() function to only include values of zsquared greater than 10 and less than 100 

variable1 <- zdf$zsquared[(zdf$zsquared > 10) & (zdf$zsquared < 100)]
variable1

variable2 <- subset(zdf, (zsquared > 10) & (zsquared < 100))

#Subset the zdf dataframe to only include the values on row 26

#Subset the zdf dataframe to only include the values in the column zsquared in the 180th row.
zdf$zsquared[180]

#Annotate your code, commit the changes and push it to your GitHub
